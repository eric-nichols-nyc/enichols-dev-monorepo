    "I’m a frontend engineer with a specialty in web accessibility, focused on building pixel-perfect, intuitive user interfaces. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering, where great user experience meets robust, clean, and scalable code.",
    "Currently, I'm a senior frontend engineer at Klaviyo, where I work on the component library team to help maintain and evolve our design system. In this role, I lead accessibility efforts across components, tooling, and patterns, partnering closely with designers and engineers to ensure accessibility is part of our core architecture.",
    "Previously, I’ve worked across a wide range of environments, from product studios to startups and large tech companies, including Apple, Starry Internet, and Upstatement. Alongside my professional work, I also created an online video course a few years ago which walks through building a real-world, API-driven application from scratch. These experiences have shaped how I think about building products that are both well-crafted and widely usable.",
    "Outside of work, you can usually find me climbing, playing tennis, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds.",
